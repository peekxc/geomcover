`geomcover` is a Python package built to simplify constructing geometric set covers over a variety of geometric objects, 
such as metric graphs and manifolds. Such covers can be used for simplifying surfaces, constructing fiber bundles, 
or summarizing point cloud data.

`geomcover` can be used natively with manifolds from the geomstats package to produce high-coverage 
bundle parameterizations of the manifold.
