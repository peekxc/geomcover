# cover.set_cover_greedy { #geomcover.cover.set_cover_greedy }

`cover.set_cover_greedy(subsets, weights=None)`

Approximates the weighted set cover problem via _greedy steps_.

This function iteratively constructs a set cover by choosing the set that covers the largest number
of yet uncovered elements. This greedy strategy is known to multiplicative $\log(d + 1)$-approximation
to the weighted set cover problem.

Relative to other algorithms, the greedy strategy tends to be the most computationally efficient, though
certain types of inputs can lead to arbitrarily bad covers.

|-----------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `subsets` | sparray               | (n x J) sparse matrix of ``J`` subsets whose union forms a cover over ``n`` points. | _required_ |
| `weights` | Optional\[ArrayLike\] | (J)-length array of subset weights.                                                 | `None`     |

## Returns
