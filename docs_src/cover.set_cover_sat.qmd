`cover.set_cover_sat(subsets, weights=None, full_output=False, **kwargs)`

Computes an approximate solution to the weighted set cover problem via *weighted MaxSAT*.

This function converts the problem of finding a minimal weight set cover to a weighted MaxSAT instance,         which is known to achieve at least an (8/7)-approximation of the optimal solution.

The default solver is the Relaxed Cardinality Constraint solver (RC2), with Boolean lexicographic optimization  (BLO) stratification options turned on. RC2 requires `python-sat` to be installed.

## Parameters

| Name          | Type                  | Description                                                                 | Default    |
|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `subsets`     | sparray               | (n x J) sparse matrix of J subsets whose union forms a cover over n points. | _required_ |
| `weights`     | Optional\[ArrayLike\] | (J)-length array of subset weights.                                         | `None`     |
| `full_output` | bool                  | whether to return the SAT-solver instance. Defaults to False.               | `False`    |
| `**kwargs`    | dict                  | additional keyword arguments to pass to the solver.                         | `{}`       |

## Returns
